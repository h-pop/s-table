Key concepts/challenges:
- Technologies used: TypeScript/JavaScript, HTML, CSS, webpack, webpack-dev-server
- Table with some typical business functionalities and nice styling, 

For now:
- run `npm run build` in one cmd to have live recompilation of ts files,
- run `npm run start` in second cmd, to have webpack-dev-server serve application assets.
One task will be to optimize it to have both of the above in one cmd.
